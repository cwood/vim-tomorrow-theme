Fork of chriskempson vim theme
-------------------------------

This is a fork of the origin theme. This has been modified to work better
with the vim-pretty-syntax file.

This adds colors for underlineing imported Classes. Raw & Unicode Strings I
will probably add more syntax highlighting for less and javascript since I am
primarily a django developer.
